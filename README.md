The Pulsar is a device that does the following: 
- Scans WiFi
- Selects a Network
- Shows WiFi Network details (channel, security protocol, signal strength, MAC address)
- Messenger app equipped with LoRa (in developmental stage) (equipped with LoRa Unit with Antenna (E220))
- Notes app (in developmental stage)
- SD card Read/Write operations (in developmental stage, but almost there!)

The Pulsar is a device I put together to learn firmware engineering.
It uses the M5Cardputer, an ESP32 based device which comes with a display, keyboard, and both WiFi and BLE capabilities. Moreover, the LoRa Unit with Antenna (E220) module I've equipped, though not yet fully integrated.
